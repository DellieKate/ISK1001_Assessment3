# **Feedback Log**

This markdown file serves as a feedback log for the KLM LabTest Advisor project for the ISK1001 Assessment 3. The rubric requires that each group illustrate documentation and tracking of both recieved and offered feedback. Here you will find our repository of our groups feedback.

Our approach to feedback management follows a two-prong approach:

#### **Pillar 1: General Documentation Quality & Usefulness**
- Core task(s): creating "appropriate documentation... for a user to utilise the features of the application."
- The feedback here should answer the question: "As a new developer joining your project, does your documentation give me everything I need to understand and run your code?"
- We want to be able to say, “Yes it does.”

#### **Pillar 2: Ethical & Security Considerations**
- This is the specific, industry-relevant part that shows a deeper level of professional thinking.
- The feedback here answers the question: "Have we considered the professional responsibilities and risks associated with the application?"
