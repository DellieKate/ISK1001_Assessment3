# **Feedback Log**

This markdown file serves as a feedback log for the KLM LabTest Advisor project for the ISK1001 Assessment 3. The rubric requires that each group illustrate documentation and tracking of both recieved and offered feedback. Here you will find our repository of our groups feedback.

----

Our approach to feedback management follows a two-prong approach:

#### **Pillar 1: General Documentation Quality & Usefulness**
- Core task(s): creating "appropriate documentation... for a user to utilise the features of the application."
- The feedback here should answer the question: "As a new developer joining your project, does your documentation give me everything I need to understand and run your code?"
- We want to be able to say, “Yes it does.”

#### **Pillar 2: Ethical & Security Considerations**
- This is the specific, industry-relevant part that shows a deeper level of professional thinking.
- The feedback here answers the question: "Have we considered the professional responsibilities and risks associated with the application?"

### **Running log of recieved feedback**
**[date: title of log]**
- Here we will store a running list of recieved feedback.

### **Feed Back Session 1: [date]**

#### **Giving Feedback 1 Checklist: Group x [name 1, 2, 3]:**
----
##### **README Review**
- [ ] Clarity of Purpose:Are the project's purpose and features clearly explained?
- [ ] Installation Test: Are all dependencies listed in requirements.txt? Can I create a virtual environment, install the dependencies from requirements.txt, and have it work on the first try?
- [ ] Usage Instructions: Are the instructions on how to run and use the application clear enough for a first-time user? Do they work? Is there an example command?
- [ ] Project Structure: Is the explanation of the file structure clear? Do I know the purpose of each .py file from the description?

##### **Code Comment Review (pick one or two files):**
-  [ ] Function Docstrings: Does each function have a comment/docstring explaining its purpose, what arguments it takes (Args), and what it returns (Returns)?
-  [ ] Class Docstrings: If they use classes, is the purpose of each class explained?
-  [ ] Clarity of Comments: Are the comments easy to understand? Do they explain the why behind complex code, not just what the code does?
-  [ ] Imported Code: Is it clear why external libraries are being used? Is their source/purpose mentioned?

##### **Ethical & Security Review (using your Google Doc as a guide):**
- [ ] Data Handling: What kind of data does this app create, store, or process (e.g., user input, scores, configuration files)? Is this data handled appropriately? (e.g., Is a game's high score list stored in a way that can't be easily cheated?).
- [ ] Input Validation: How does the app handle incorrect or malicious user input? Does it crash, or does it handle the error gracefully? (e.g., What happens if you enter text where a number is expected?).
- [ ] Access & Permissions: Who is the intended user? Does the app have any features that should be restricted or protected in some way?
- [ ] Accountability & Consequences: What are the potential negative consequences if the app produces an incorrect result or fails? Is there a disclaimer or warning to the user about the app's limitations?
- [ ] Licensing & Attribution: Does the app use external code or assets? If so, is the license for that code compatible with their project, and is it properly attributed in the README?
